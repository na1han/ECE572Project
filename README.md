Ball Balancing on Table

A project for ECE 572 in which we will demonstrate image processing and a control structure by using a webcam with 
a computer to output a location of a ball on a table to an arduino.  The ardiuno will then tilt the table by commanding
servos to move to keep the ball at a defined locations.
